## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by opening a new issue on the project's GitHub repository. Be sure to provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it.

Once a vulnerability has been reported, the project maintainers will review it and acknowledge the report within 7 business days.

Depending on the severity of the issue, a patch may be released immediately or included in the next scheduled update.

Please note that not all reported vulnerabilities may be accepted. The project maintainers reserve the right to decline a vulnerability report if it is deemed to be a low-risk issue or if it conflicts with the project's design or architecture. In such cases, we will provide an explanation for the decision.
