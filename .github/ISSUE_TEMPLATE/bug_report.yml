        **IMPORTANT:** Please follow these guidelines:
        - Before submitting, search closed issues to see if the problem has already been addressed. If a related issue exists, comment on it rather than opening a new one.
        - Support is limited to the default Linux distributions. Custom environments or modifications may not be supported.
        - If you encounter `[ERROR] in line 23: exit code *: while executing command "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1`, rerun the script with verbose mode (`-v`) before submitting the issue.
        - Use the [Discussions section](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/discussions) for questions, feature requests, or suggestions.
