    "description": "Paperless-ngx is a software tool designed for digitizing and organizing paper documents. It provides a web-based interface for scanning, uploading, and organizing paper documents, making it easier to manage, search, and access important information. Paperless-ngx uses the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract text from scanned images and makes it searchable, thus increasing the efficiency of document management.",
